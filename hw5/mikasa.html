	Mikasa is Eren's adopted sister who is taken in by his family.[GB p. 36] She is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. When Mikasa's parents were killed by slave traders, she went into shock until Eren saves her and motivates her to fight back.[ch. 6][ep 6] As a result, she is very protective of Eren, and follows him wherever she can in joining the military and its related divisions and squads.[vol. 2,3][GB p.37] She is the last-known person of Asian descent residing in the Walls[ch. 6][ep 6][GB p.39] She graduates at the top of the cadet class,[ch. 2] and is regarded by officers as an unprecedented genius and prodigy, easily worth a hundred men in battle.[vol. 3,4] In the author's blog, Isayama notes that her name comes from the Mikasa, a battleship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.[6]
Mikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in the Japanese dub.[GB p.20] In the English dub, her surname is spelled Ackermann,[ep 1] and she is voiced by Trina Nishimura.[7][8] In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Kiko Mizuhara.[4] Ishikasa says that Mikasa cares mainly about Eren, and keeps a distance from the rest of the world. She says that "While she might seem like a character with so few emotional levels, there are actually many feelings that swirl around her heart."[GB p.20]
