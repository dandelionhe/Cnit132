	The main protagonist of the series who after witnessing his mother being devoured by a Titan, dedicates his life to their eradication. After graduating fifth in his cadet class, he is swallowed by a bearded Titan during his first mission in Trost.[vol. 1] However, he soon reappears as a 15-meter (49 ft) Rogue Titan who fights other Titans on equal ground.[vol. 1][vol. 2] His ability as the "Rogue Titan" makes him the target of multiple parties that include those who see him as a tool to eradicate the Titans, other humans who can become Titans, and those who perceive Eren as a rebellion-inducing threat to the status quo.[vol. 2,3] Placed into the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, he attempts to control his Titan-changing ability and discovers he has other abilities as well. Author Hajime Isayama stated that Eren's Titan form's physique was modeled after middleweight mixed martial artist Yushin Okami.[1][2]
Eren is voiced by YÅ«ki Kaji in the Japanese dub.[GB p.19] In the Funimation English dub, his name is spelled Eren Jaeger and he is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook.[3] In the live-action film, Eren is portrayed by Haruma Miura[4] In his voicing, Papenbrook noted the character's guttural screams and the "raw sound" and "disgusting and dirty" voice of Eren's Titan form.[5]
