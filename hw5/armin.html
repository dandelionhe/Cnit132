	Armin is Eren's childhood friend who joins him in the Scouts. He has an inferiority complex, believing he barely passed the combat graduation exam (but was top of the class academically),[ch. 3] and whining that he hates being cowardly and having to rely on friends all the time.[ch. 11] Despite his self-perceived shortcomings, he vigorously defends Eren when the Military wanted to fire cannons at them, and brings Eren out of his feral Titan state following the latter's second full transformation where he attacks Mikasa,[vol. 3] Armin convinces Eren to overcome his hesitation to fight Annie. In the military, he impresses the higher-ups by deducing the human identity of the Female Titan.[ep 24][GB p. 40-43]
Armin is voiced by Marina Inoue in the Japanese anime dub.[GB p.20] The English dub spells his last name Arlelt,[ep 1] and Josh Grelle voices him.[9] In the live-action feature film, Kanata Hong≈ç plays Armin. Inoue describes Armin as "withdrawn but slowly grows to the point where he's able to say what he believes".[GB p.20]
